## Description


Employee attrition, or workforce turnover, is a critical metric for organizations striving to maintain stability, productivity, and profitability. High attrition rates can result in significant costs, including recruitment expenses, training new hires, and the loss of institutional knowledge.

This project explores employee attrition by analyzing various factors such as job satisfaction, salary hikes, work-life balance, and demographic details. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. By leveraging this predictive capability, businesses can identify key drivers of attrition and implement proactive strategies to improve employee retention.
## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to analyze employee attrition data to identify the key factors influencing workforce turnover and develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. By achieving this, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that help businesses improve employee retention and make informed decisions to enhance organizational stability.
## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis of employee attributes and attrition patterns to uncover key insights.

## Analytical Interpretation

1) People are tending to switch to a different jobs at the start of their careers, or at the earlier parts of it. Once they have settled with a family or have found stability in their jobs, they tend to stay long in the same organization- only going for vertical movements in the same organization.
2) Salary and stock ptions have a great motivation on the employees and people tend to leave the organization much lesser. Higher pay and more stock options have seen more employees remain loyal to their company.
3) Work life balance is a great motivation factor for the employees. However, people with a good work-life balance, tend to switch in search of better opportunities and a better standard of living.
4) Departments where target meeting performance is very much crucial (for e.g. Sales) tend to have a greater chances of leaving the organization as compared to departments with more administration perspective (For e.g. Human Resources)
5) People with a good Job Satisfaction and Environment satisfaction are loyal to the organization- and this speaks loud for any Organization. However, people who are not much satisfied with their current project- tend to leave the organization far more.

## Model Conclusion


From the results of dataset analysis and implementation of machine learning models, it can be concluded as follows:

Logistic regression was comparatively the best machine-learning model followed by Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel) and KNN respectively. This is because this model fits well with train and test data.

The prediction results on test data, dummy data, and the complete machine learning pipeline have been successfully exported for other purposes. In addition, data exploration has also been successfully carried out using the ydata-profiling, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries.

Several improvements can be implemented in the following research/notebook. Another example is performing advanced hyperparameter tuning experiments to obtain higher accuracy (~90%).
